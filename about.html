            I have always been a “gamer“. At first, I just enjoyed playing video games in my spare time, but eventually
            I began to consider video games as an education and career path. In 2019, I took my first related course
            Video Games and the Individual in which we were asked to play and analyze different games. While I enjoyed
            playing the game “Minecraft Hour of Code”, I admired how designers use the game to promote coding skills for
            players who may have no background in programming. Throughout this course, I was introduced to how video
            games relate to other technologies and their impact on individuals, communities, and society at large. At
            the end of this course, I conducted research on a game called “Chinese Parents“, a life simulation that
            modeled the challenges and anxieties of growing up with traditional Chinese parents, which attempts to
            provide a better understanding of the stress of raising children in the unique social environment from a
            parent’s perspective.

            During my academic studies, I have accomplished a variety of projects which equipped me with the technical
            skills and knowledge to enter the game industry. Through courses offered from the Computer Science and
            Engineering Department, I produced games such as a first-person maze shooter and “World 1-1” of Nintendo’s
            Zelda 2D using programming tools C# and Unity, practicing familiarity in game physics, engine, map, 2D
            graphic, and sound, as well as identifying the approach to software development through the values and
            principles of the Agile Manifesto. In the double major, I was able to take communication courses like
            Human-Computer Interaction and User-Centered Design to reevaluate designs from different perspectives. I was
            taught to conduct benchmarking on original products using design principles and redesigned a Bluetooth
            speaker by improving user experience with enhanced visual appearance and functionality.
