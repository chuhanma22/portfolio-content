        <h2>Wiki</h2>
        <p>
            Thatgamecompany, Inc. (stylized as thatgamecompany) is an American independent video game development
            company founded by University of Southern California students Jenova Chen and Kellee Santiago in 2006. The
            company was a developer for Sony Computer Entertainment, contracted to create three downloadable games for
            the PlayStation 3's PlayStation Network service, and has since secured independent funding. The first of
            their games is a remake of Chen's award-winning Flash title Flow, with enhanced visuals and sound, added
            multiplayer modes and compatibility with the PlayStation 3's motion-sensitive controller. The title was
            released on the PlayStation Store in 2007. The company's second PlayStation 3 game, Flower, was released on
            the PlayStation Store in 2009, and their third game, Journey, was released in March 2012 on the PlayStation
            Store. Their fourth game, Sky: Children of the Light, was released in July 2019 on iOS and in April 2020 on
            Android, and later released on the Nintendo Switch in June 2021.
        </p>

        <p>
            According to Jenova Chen, the company focuses on creating video games that provoke emotional responses from
            players. He has stated that, while the company is not opposed to making action-oriented games, he believes
            that enough such titles are released by the established video game industry. When designing a game, Chen and
            Thatgamecompany's process is to start by mapping out what the game should make the player feel, rather than
            by establishing game mechanics. Chen has stated that the company does not plan to produce large, blockbuster
            titles, due to their belief that the pressure for high sales would stifle innovation.
