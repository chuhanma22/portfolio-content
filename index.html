        <p>
            Sky: Children of the Light (shortened to Sky in-game) is an open world social indie adventure game developed
            and published by Thatgamecompany. It was first released for iOS
            on July 18, 2019. An Android version was later released on April 7, 2020, and a Nintendo Switch version was
            released on June 29, 2021. A beta version was available before release, which was used by players to give
            feedback on fixes for the main game. In August 2022, Thatgamecompany announced that
            the game would be coming to unspecified PlayStation platforms, and they later announced that the game would
            be released on PlayStation platforms in December 2022.
        </p>

        <p>
            In Sky, players explore a once-prosperous kingdom using a cape that allows them to fly. The in-game world
            consists of seven unique realms, each with a variety of areas to explore, and a theme representing different
            stages of life. There is also Home, a small island which serves as the world hub and the starting point for
            the player. Throughout the world, players encounter "spirits" that allow them to unlock items in return for
            in-game currency, and "children of light" that give players "winged light." When a player has collected
            enough winged light, their cape level goes up, allowing them to fly farther.
        </p>

        <p>
            The game places heavy focus on social mechanics. Players are able to meet and befriend one another, and can
            unlock new abilities such as chat and sending gifts as their friendship grows. There are also many cosmetic
            items to collect including capes, masks, hairstyles, hats, pants, playable musical instruments, expressions,
            and more. These items can be obtained using in-game currency or, in some cases, purchased with real life
            money. Some cosmetics are only available to select players, such as the original beta cape, only available
            to those who played the beta version prior to the full release of the game.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sky has multiple in-game currencies. "Candles" are the main currency of Sky, and are exchanged with spirits
            and friends in return for items and abilities. Candles are obtained by collecting pieces of light (called
            wax in game) and forging them, or by purchasing them for real money. "Hearts" are the social currency of
            Sky, and are obtained when players receive gifts from others, or can be bought directly from spirits with
            candles. Hearts are primarily used to purchase cosmetic items from spirits. "Ascended candles" are the
            rarest currency in Sky, which are rewarded to players for giving their winged light to "The fallen" at the
            end of the game. Ascended candles are exchanged with spirits for "wing buffs," which give players extra
            Winged Light, or can be used to upgrade friendship and purchase various spells such as height alteration and
            cape recharge.
