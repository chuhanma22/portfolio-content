        <p> Welcome to my website. </p>
        <p> I’m a graduate student at UMSI, a game designer and also a game lover. </p>

        <p>
            I believe human-computer interaction will become more common in the future. With the development of science
            and technology, human-computer interaction has become an indispensable part of life. Not only Smart
            technology such as mobile phones, but also artificial intelligence, and other aspects are inseparable from
            human-computer interaction. After realizing these functions, the user-centered design will become more
            important. With the increasing inventions of the number of products, many industries are facing saturation.
            Better user-centered design designs will stand out as a result. Thus, the major trends of information
            science will be the development of human-computer interactions which includes UX design.
        </p>

            I hold double degrees in Computer Science and Communication from the Ohio State University where I focused
            on Game Studies and Human-Computer Interaction. I have 4 years of programming experience in Java, Python,
            Ruby on Rails, etc. I’m always looking to utilize and bring my skills in computer science and art together.
            I’m currently pursuing my Master's degree in the School of Information. I’ve completed related courses
            during my undergraduate school: Introduction to data visualization (CSE5544, earned an A), Introduction to
            data mining (CSE5243, earned an A-), Interactive Systems (CSE3902, earned an A), etc. From 2020 to 2022, I
            also worked as a research assistant with Prof. Roselyn Lee-Won in designing interactive ways to attract,
            track, and analyze the public’s interest in becoming bone marrow donors for transplant.
